After finding a strong lack of artistic examples of data presentation, we decided to make some Data Murals of our own!  We help a group find a story in their data, collaboratively create a visual design that tells the story, and then paint it as a community mural. We’ve done a number of data murals, in the US and beyond.  Here’s a small gallery of that work:
