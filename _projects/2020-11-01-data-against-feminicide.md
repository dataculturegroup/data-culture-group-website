Gender-related violence against women is a global problem. Efforts to prevent this often produce laws that are un-enforced, and even less work is done measure the impact and scope of the problem with concrete data. Activists, civil society organizations, journalists, and individual community members have stepped in to fill this gap. In many places they have build intensive processes based on published news to build databases of feminicides.

We are supporting these groups by collaboratively designing technologies that can help them automate some of this work. We can teach machines to surface potentially relevant news articles. We can build tools to help them extract relevant data from a news report and prepare it for entry into their tracking databases. We can design these systems together.

Our contribution to the overall project focuses on integration with the [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org) platform.
