Fab labs are well established spaces where novices are introduced to creative outputs through the use of digital fabrication tools. The idea has grown since around 2000, now encompassing a worldwide network or people, tools, and pedagogy.

We've built a number of tools to support these explorations in Fab labs, but the most popular and long-lived one is our Box Designer. Enter dimensions and PDF Designer will generate a design file you can use to cut out a notched press-fit box on a laser-cutter. Over the last 10 years, people are used it to create over 2.5 million box designs. BoxDesigner began as a java desktop app back in 2001, then migrated into a Ruby web-app that spoke to the java design library, and now is an open-source Python web-tool and library that has integrated changes from many other developers.
