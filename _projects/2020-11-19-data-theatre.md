Data is historically considered a tool for analytic support through visual interpretation, overlooking the potential of embodied representations. In this work we explore theatre as a path to creating new understandings of information, and bringing people together, to increase collective empowerment and engagement. This builds on well-established patterns of theatrical production such as playback theatre, image theatre, viewpoints, and research-based theatre. These existing practices inform and underlie our attemps to move beyond traditional flat visualizations and leverage experiential modes of understanding to build new types of representation that empower individuals and communities.
