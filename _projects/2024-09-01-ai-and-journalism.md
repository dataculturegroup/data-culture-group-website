Generative AI has impacted technologies in many fields, including journalism. The dominant approaches are focused on threats and opportunities: copyright, manufactured content, writing and editing, automated analysis, and beyond. Our focus is to track developments to understand themes that are emerging at the intersection of genAI and journalism, to explore how new technologies can assist media, researchers working with large data corpora of online news, and to work with newsrooms on new technologies that leverage large language models to support their important work.
