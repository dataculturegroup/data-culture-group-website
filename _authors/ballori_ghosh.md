name: Ballori Ghosh
bio: Iâ€™m a fresh out of the oven Software Engineering graduate student. My interests lie in different ways of representing data and in understanding the socio economic effects of immersive technology. When I am not working , a good book and a steaming cup of coffee helps me slow down and relax :)
