CLIFF-CLAVIN parses news articles and pulls out people, organizations and places mentioned. A number of tools do this, so why did we create CLIFF-CLAVIN? We've built on those tools to add disambiguation tailored to the ways news articles are written, and a concept of "focus" that tries to get at what place an article is really about (as opposed to all the places it mentions). We create CLIFF-CLAVIN to help drive the [Media Cloud suite](https://mediacloud.org/) of media analysis tools, but are sharing it in hopes that others find it useful.
