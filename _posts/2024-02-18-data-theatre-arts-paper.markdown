Excited to share a new paper published by the Data Theatre Collaborative in Arts: [Viewpoints/Points of View: Building a Transdisciplinary Data Theatre Collaboration in Six Scenes](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/13/1/37).  Instead of a traditional academic paper, we chose to write up our study as a six-scene script, aiming to capture the complex dynamics of our interdisciplinary team and the process of creating data theatre. This unique format allowed us to bring our research process to life, focusing on how data science, theatre, and community engagement intersect to make data more accessible and meaningful.

Using improvisation and movement exercises, we experimented with transforming abstract data points into relatable human experiences. For instance, one scene involved actors representing local housing data through physical space and movement, making visible the real-life impact of statistics on rent, income, and displacement. This approach let us explore the ethical questions that come with representing community stories through data and theatre, ensuring that these portrayals respect and reflect lived realities.

Presenting our findings as a play wasn’t just for creativity’s sake—it was a way to challenge conventional research presentation and address ethical concerns around data representation. By using the language of theatre, we invite our audience to think critically about how data affects real lives and to consider the role of community voices in data interpretation. This process emphasized that making data legible and impactful for communities requires collaborative methods that put people—and their stories—at the center.

Give it a read and consider how the format alters how you connect with and consider the research.
