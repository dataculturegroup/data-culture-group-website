Here’s the fourth in my series of round-ups on the latest in artificial intelligence and journalism. Budding uses of AI in newsrooms

The Online News Association [launched a new AI in Journalism Initiative](https://journalists.org/programs/ai-in-journalism-initiative/) to support journalist’s explorations of how AI technologies could help their work. They’re planning to offer training, community building, lesson sharing and broader convening.

Curious about what people are doing now? [Columbia Journalism Review shared a vision](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/ai-opportunity-news-media-lets-not-blow-it.php) for how newsrooms can adjust and experiment with AI technologies, and released [a new Tow Center report](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/artificial-intelligence-in-the-news.php) on new organizations’ motivations, techniques and expectations. More concretely, [Pew Research wrote about how they used LLMs](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/06/how-we-used-large-language-models-to-identify-guests-on-popular-podcasts/) to pull out guest names from popular podcasts. Their findings? After some validation on a sample, they found the model effectively replaced tedious manual desk work via automation.

### Dealing with generated content?
Search engines face the looming challenge of dealing with reams of AI-generated content. [404 reported on Google’s apparent apathy](https://www.404media.co/google-news-is-boosting-garbage-ai-generated-articles/) to whether the content is human-created or not. A new scandal emerged and faded quickly: [Car & Driver reported](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a46353319/formula-e-team-fires-ai-generated-influencer/) on Formula E removing their AI-generated influencer after fan backlash. The key comment? Outrage that motorsports would be so unwelcoming to women that only a virtual one could make it. [They apologized, kind of](https://www.instagram.com/p/C189P-TujYL/).

This growth in manufactured content spills over to impacts on individuals. University Of Washington professor Dr. Emily Bender found a completely fabricated quote in a story published by Bihar, India news site Biharprabha. [Read more the full story from The Quint](https://www.thequint.com/explainers/ai-generated-article-published-by-bihar-news-site-fake-quote-a-wake-up-call).

### What the future holds
Storybench reported on a few Northeastern events that tried to read the tea leaves and speculate about the future and social impact of AI on media. [Jill Abramson and Ethan Zuckerman spoke at length about](https://www.storybench.org/how-openai-is-changing-the-way-we-process-information/) what the future might hold at an “AI and the Media” event.

A few days later [Chris Perry gave a book talk on “Perspective Agents”](https://www.storybench.org/chris-perry-explores-the-impact-of-ai-on-future-media/), offering another take on what the future of AI and media holds. More speculatively, the Open Society Foundation hosted a (now-closed) [call for imagining the future of AI and journalism](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/focus/open-society-ai-in-journalism-futures) 5–15 years out; keep an eye out for the fully fleshed out scenarios they’ll share this summer.

### Continued copyright concerns (and deals)
That lawsuit between The New York Times and OpenAI continues to unfold: [ArsTechnica published some commentary](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/why-the-new-york-times-might-win-its-copyright-lawsuit-against-openai/) about the core legal questions, OpenAI claimed [NYT cheated](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084843/openai-new-york-times-dismiss-copyright-claims-lawsuit) and Professor Nick Diakopoulos [shared some experimental results](https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/fair-use-copyright-and-the-challenge-of-memorization-in-the-nyt-vs-openai-7f6c0a13f703) to try and explain parts of the filing. Meanwhile, [more publishers are suing](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085973/intercept-raw-story-alternet-openai-lawsuit-copyright) OpenAI and Microsoft.

It’s going to take years to determine if this kind of use is transformative or not, but companies are still raking in the training data. [Rumors emerged that Reddit signed a licensing deal](https://mashable.com/article/reddit-signs-ai-content-licensing-deal) with an AI company to allow use of their users’s posts to train models. [The Verge reported on the breakdown](https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders) in respect for the robots.txt file that has (so-far) been treated as “rules of the road” for scraping content; now AI companies are simply ignoring it. The results are quite apparent: [The Times found](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/25/business/ai-image-generators-openai-microsoft-midjourney-copyright.html) Midjourney regularly created images that clearly violate copyright law.
