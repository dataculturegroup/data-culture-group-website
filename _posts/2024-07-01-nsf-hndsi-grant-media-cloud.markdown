We’re thrilled to announce that [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org) has secured new [NSF HNDS-I grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2341858&HistoricalAwards=false) to take our global news archive and director to the next level! This grant enables us to extend and enhance our searchable news database, which currently includes nearly 2 billion documents. With this funding, we’ll improve infrastructure and introduce new tools to support impactful social science research. Media Cloud is emerging as a piece of critical public data infrastructure to support a wide variety of types of research across disciplines.

Our renewed work aims to provide researchers with unprecedented access to global online news data and powerful new visualizations. Researchers across fields—politics, health communication, economics, disinformation—will be able to track and analyze media narratives and framing with ease. We’re expanding our indexing capabilities, creating more flexible data collections, and improving stability so that the archive is as accessible as it is powerful.

Our commitment to social impact means that non-profits, journalists, and advocacy organizations can also use Media Cloud to support their work in media monitoring, social change, and public health. We’re planning new tutorials and features designed for users new to computational tools.

Stay tuned as we bring you updates on new features, collaborations, and ways to join us in exploring the world’s online news landscapes.
