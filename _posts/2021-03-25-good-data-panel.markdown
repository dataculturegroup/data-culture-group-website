I'll speaking on April 9th with on the Angeles Martinez Cuba (of [MIT's Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu)) on the "Good Data / Data for [Public] Good" Panel at the NULab's Annual Spring Conference. We'll be discussing some of the [under-construction technology co-design work we are doing](/projects/counterdata-network.html) with global advocates compiling databases of gender-related killings.
