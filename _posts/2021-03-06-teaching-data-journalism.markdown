> Against a backdrop of systemic disruption in the field of journalism writ large, data journalism represents a subarea that is undergoing rapid transformation due to the intro- duction of new tools and techniques as well as the changes in reporting practices as journalists and newsrooms experi- ment and innovate. This paper explores the challenges for data journalism educators to teach in such a rapidly shifting landscape. Drawing from our experiences teaching journal- ism students in higher education, we assert that the goal of data journalism education amidst this complexity is not to teach tech, nor even to teach technical skills, but rather to model for students strategies of dealing with transforma- tion and complexity. These include peer learning, hands-on learning activities, modeling learning and information seek- ing, and establishing a culture of critique. We introduce a number of activities that put those approaches into prac- tice, drawing on learning literature to support our fellow ed- ucators shifting from the “banking model” of education[10] to a learner-centered model[23]. Working with students to co-create knowledge, acting as a “Guide on the Side”[15] can help better prepare students for the constantly evolv- ing ecosystem of technologies and tools that support data journalism.

Presented at the [AEJMC Mid-Winter Conference](https://www.aejmc.org) in March of 2021.
